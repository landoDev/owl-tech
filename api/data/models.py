"""
This file contains the data models in Python that would represent the structure of the data if it were to be stored in a PostgreSQL database.
The purpose of this file is to show how I would model the data; the actual logic of the app uses the csv file `stock-data.csv`
"""

# separate out and understand what these data points are, what repeats, what's relational? 
# create a series of classes as you would for a sqlalchemy implementation (without the HOF and such)

# a stock has a `name` as it's `id`
# that one stock has several dates (each day that passes)
# each stock's date is associated with it's volume worth at close in usd
# many stocks have one sector level (1 and 2)
