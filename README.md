## Getting Started

#### **First things first, let's stand up the backend. From the project root, go into the `api` directory:**

```bash
cd api
```

1. Install poetry if not already installed:
    > [Poetry Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for more on installation.

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
    ```

2. In `owl-tech/api`, install the required dependencies using Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

4. Run the app using Uvicorn:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser to confirm the api is up!

6. Access the FastAPI interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore the available endpoints and interact with the live test scores.

#### **Now that your backend is up and the api is listening it's time to fire up the UI!**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory. `ui/web/`
2. Install the required dependencies. 
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
3. Start the frontend application.
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
4. Head to `localhost:3000/`. From here you can change the year on the top right and click on the name to select a single asset.
Each asset's page has a return calculator and it's own table shown. Clicking on `OWL Stock Prices` will bring you back to the home page.
