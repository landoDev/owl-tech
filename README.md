# Old Well Labs - Stock Price 

* Backend Requirements:
    - Create data models in Python that would represent the structure of the data if it were to be stored in a PostgreSQL database.
    - Develop a RESTful API that reads the stock price data directly from the provided CSV file and uses the data models to structure the API responses.
    - Implement endpoints for listing all stock data, retrieving data for a specific asset and calculating cumulative returns between two dates.

* Frontend Requirements:
    - Develop a frontend application that displays the stock price data served by the backend. Just the price series overtime is fine.
    - The frontend should allow users to view the list of all assets and their prices and select individual assets to view more details.
